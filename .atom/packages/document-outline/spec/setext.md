------------------------
Might start with heading: and have colon
------------------------


This is for using setext style headers
======================================

Blah blah some text

Which may also work for heading 2 level
---------------------------------------

This is the level 2 text

### Here we might have ATX header instead

Which should fit into the same hierarchy as the the setext ones

# Also if we choose to mix with ATX header that's cool too

Although you need to have some text in it for it to show up
