  "readme": "# Hybrid Next for Atom\n\nCreated for those who spend a lot of time in their text editor, Hybrid Next is a dark, colorful theme for Atom that aims to be both readable and easy on the eyes. This theme is specifically designed to be used in tandem with the [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) language package for JavaScript, as it allows for more fine-grained control over applicable styles. That being said, this theme should work well for other languages (degrading gracefully when used with the regular JavaScript language package) and yield similar syntax highlighting results to GitHub's [One Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax), which it is built on top of.\n\n## About\n\nThis project was born out of my frustration while searching for a color scheme that was both easy on the eyes and highly readable, making it easy to distinguish important parts of the code. Special consideration has been made for JavaScript (the language that the author currently pays the bills with) in particular, with a focus on making important parts of the code stand out without being too harsh on the eyes.\n\nIn the spirit of the original Hybrid theme for Vim, Hybrid Next is inspired by [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid)'s color scheme and [Oceanic Next](http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/)'s syntax highlighting (specifically for modern JavaScript), and is built on GitHub's [One Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).\n\nWhile the author has focused mostly on better syntax highlighting for modern JavaScript (ES2015 and beyond), the theme should yield similar results to the One Dark Syntax theme it is built on and should work for most languages. It is the author's wish that this theme be useable by all communities, and [all feedback](https://github.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/issues) as well as pull requests are very welcome (particularly for other languages the author doesn't spend as much time with)!\n\n## Screenshots\n\nScreenshots are snippets of code from the [Babel project](https://github.com/babel/babel). Language package used is the excellent [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) and the font is the equally excellent [Hack font](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/master/screenshots/hybrid-next-screenshot-1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/master/screenshots/hybrid-next-screenshot-2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/master/screenshots/hybrid-next-screenshot-3.png)\n",
