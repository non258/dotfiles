Single click to jump to heading in document, double click to collapse sub-headings.\n\nAlternatively, enable the outline view of Atom-IDE (and disable the `show by default` setting).\n\nNote: for simplicity, only 'modern' UI themes are supported (i.e. not the atom-light or atom-dark themes). Should work for popular UI themes including One-light/dark and Atom-material.\n\n\n## Why?\n\nIt's easy to get lost working on long documents - an outline view is a huge help. With document-outline, jump to headings in your document, and see the currently edited section highlighted in the outline.\n\n## See also\n\nSome handy packages for working on long form markdown documents:\n\n- [preview-inline](https://atom.io/packages/preview-inline) (shameless plug) allows quick inline previews of LaTeX math equations and images in documents without having to generate a preview\n- [language-pfm](https://atom.io/packages/language-pfm) syntax highlighting for the pandoc variety of markdown\n- [markdown preview plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) enhanced HTML preview of markdown documents\n- [build](https://atom.io/packages/build) plus `build-makefile`. If you use Pandoc to build serious documents, your pandoc command starts to get pretty fancy. Do yourself a favour and write a makefile for that, then use atom-build to easily trigger building your document from the editor.\n\n\n## TODO\n\n- drag-and-drop reordering of headings\n\nContributions welcome!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mangecoeur/document-outline/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mangecoeur/document-outline#readme","_id":"document-outline@2.0.1","_shasum":"f1cc9a521c40cc0ed137025fc76db291561d4c12","_resolved":"file:../d-118115-30574-1rpzstv.tkis1hsemi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-118115-30574-1rpzstv.tkis1hsemi/package.tgz"}
